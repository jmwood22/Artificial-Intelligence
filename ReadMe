Welcome to the Numbrix Read Me.

In order to play the game, you must run the file Numbrix.java.

You will then be prompted to input the name of the file containing
the initial game data. I have included two of these files called
InitGameData1 and InitGameData2 if you do not have one yourself.
However, if you want to use your own file it must be organized in
the following manner:

The first number should be the width or height of the desired grid.
The following lines will be the "setup moves" meaning they should 
consist of three numbers (row, column, value) with only spaces
between them.

After the file is read, the on-screen directions should guide you.
The addition boards are files Board1-7, and the tournament boards 
Tourn1-17. When the game is ready to play, press 5 to allow the AI 
to play and when it is done, the solution and the time in 
milliseconds will be displayed but to show the move history, press 3.
In order to read a new file with stopping and restarting the 
program, press 6 and make a new file selection.Remember to press 
enter after making a selection and try not to find any bugs!!!

Thanks,
Jeffrey Wood
